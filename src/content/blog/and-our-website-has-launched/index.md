I am absolutely thrilled that our project is now well underway. I've been chipping away at it in brief intervals for the past 12 months but often work and life has gotten too busy and it has sat idle. But much like endurance training, consistency is king. As of June 2023, I've made a commitment to make multiple code commits per week and get the app to market before end of year. It is my hope that this platform will change the way athletes train and help coaches scale.
