The [Local Legends in Running Podcast](https://open.spotify.com/show/5Fo6hoM27djoiyyky4amKl?si=30236ca701d14c8a) Road to Osaka Series documents the marathon training build of Clive Gross, [Bush Turkey Track Club](http://www.bushturkey.club) runner of Brisbane, and Kyle Weise, coach of [Kyles Run Coaching](https://www.instagram.com/kylesruncoaching/) on the Gold Coast. They detail their training weeks along with discussing important marathon topics such as nutrition, mental applications, race strategies and footwear.

Here's the full quote by Nietzche that I reference on the pod when discussing racing mantras:

> "The most spiritual men, as the strongest, find their happiness where others would find their destruction: in the labyrinth, in hardness against themselves and others, in experiments. Their joy is self-conquest: asceticism becomes in them nature, need, and instinct. Difficult tasks are a privilege to them; to play with burdens that crush others, a recreation."
> 
> **Friedrich Nietzsche**
