We're excited to announce that the Chiron website has officially moved from WordPress to a brand‑new Astro-powered platform!

## Why the Change?

The previous WordPress site served us well, but as Chiron has grown, so have our needs. We wanted a website that was:

- **Faster**
- **Cleaner**
- **Easier to maintain**
- **Better for long‑form content like training guides, app documentation, and engineering posts**
- **More reliable to publish and share**

Astro delivers all of this—and more.

## Why Astro?

[Astro](https://astro.build/) is a modern web framework designed for content‑rich websites. It gives us:

### 🚀 Lightning‑Fast Performance

Astro ships **zero JavaScript by default**, meaning pages load instantly and feel great on any device.

### ✨ A Beautiful, Modern UI

The new site looks cleaner, more intentional, and more aligned with Chiron’s identity as a premium endurance training tool.

### 🧩 A Better Writing & Publishing Workflow

Astro makes it simple for us to write clean, portable Markdown content with version control.  
That means:

- Updates are easier
- Errors are fewer
- Content stays consistent
- Sharing is seamless

### 🔌 Fully Extensible

Want dark mode? Easy.  
Want interactive charts? Done.  
Want docs, blogs, and landing pages living under one system? Perfect.

Astro has opened the door for Chiron to grow its content in ways WordPress made painful.

## What This Means for You

- **Better reading experience** for training tips, engineering deep dives, and project updates
- **Faster access** to calculators, tools, and documentation
- **More content more often** because publishing is now frictionless
- **A more stable platform**—no plugins to break, no surprise theme updates

## Want the Source Code?

If you like the new site, the source code is available on GitHub at [https://github.com/chironapp/chiron-website](https://github.com/chironapp/chiron-website).  
Use it, clone it, borrow pieces—whatever helps you build something great for your own project.

Feel free to star the repo if you find it useful!
