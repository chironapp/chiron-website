Welcome to _Road to Osaka 2025_ – a weekly series where I’ll be sharing the ups, downs, and everything in between on my journey to the Osaka Marathon 24 Feb 2025! Through this series, I’m excited to journal my own marathon training while also documenting the development of Chiron, the endurance training app I’m building to help athletes like you optimize your performance.

Each week, I’ll be posting updates on my training progress and lessons learned. But there’s more! I’ll also be previewing Chiron’s latest features, designed to make training smarter and more seamless. For example, we’ve launched our Connected Apps feature, allowing Chiron to sync with apps and devices, such as Strava, so users can track workouts directly. In the future, Chiron will integrate with Garmin, Apple Watch and more!

Whether you’re looking for training tips, curious about building an app for athletes, or just want to follow the journey, _Road to Osaka 2025_ has something for you. Follow along on my Instagram page [@clivegross1](https://www.instagram.com/clivegross1/profilecard/?igsh=bnc1bjhmZGR3cmMy) and let’s make the road to Osaka one to remember.
