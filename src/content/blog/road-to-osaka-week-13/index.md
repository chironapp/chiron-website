In the video, I preview Chiron’s **schedule recurring workouts feature**. For anyone with a regular training routine—like a Monday recovery run, a weekly gym session, or anything in between—you can now schedule workouts to repeat for up to **90 days in advance**. It’s a game-changer for saving time and keeping consistency! I’m already using it to lock in my recovery runs and gym sessions between now and race day.

As for training, this week has been my **biggest since June 2023**—clocking 133km and capped off with a solid **marathon-specific workout** on Sunday. Highlights include:

- **Tuesday's Bush Turkey track session** featuring a “last rep hero” race with Taz that came down to a photo finish (advantage: chest hair).

- **Sunday’s 3x7km marathon effort** with a great crew including [Kyle](https://www.instagram.com/kyle_weise/), Riine, and Marty—all prepping for Osaka too. Despite the fierce headwinds, we got it done, and it was a great confidence boost.
