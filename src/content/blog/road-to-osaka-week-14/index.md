Peak mileage

Four weeks to go until [Osaka Marathon 2025](https://www.osaka-marathon.com/2025/en/), and this was my biggest training week in terms of volume—137km total, packed with quality training including a 39km long run.

This week, I also introduced a new feature in **Chiron: Event Attachments**. You can now upload race registrations, course maps, race plans, and even motivational images to keep everything in one place. I’ve already added all my key race details for Osaka—one less thing to worry about as race day approaches.

The peak is now done—time to start the taper.
