Between **peak marathon training, high work demands, home projects**, and everything else life is throwing at me, I’ve been running on fumes. A few days late on releasing this week's episode but—**we’re still getting it done.**

With so much on my plate, I didn’t have time to roll out a new Chiron feature this week, but I did do a **user experience audit** with my mate and UX expert, **Lee Hubbard**. It gave me some great insights on how to make the app smoother and more intuitive for athletes when it launches later this year.

The big effort this week was **Sunday’s [Moreton Bay Road Runners](https://www.mbrr.com.au/) 10km Time Trial**. I was hoping to run a PB, but with **a stiff headwind for the last 4km**, I had to dig deep just to hold pace. I crossed the line **14 seconds off my best**, but considering the conditions and marathon training fatigue, I’m **really happy with the result**. It’s another **confidence boost heading into taper.**

Total mileage this week: 114km. The hardest training is behind me. Now it’s time to **sharpen up and freshen up** for race day.
