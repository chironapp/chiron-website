**Chiron Connected Apps (Strava) feature and first summer marathon workout**

This week, I introduced Chiron’s new **Connected Apps** feature! Now you can sync your Strava account to automatically fetch activities and match them with planned workouts. Future integrations with Garmin and Apple Watch are in the works.

Training-wise, I logged 112km over seven runs, two gym sessions, and capped it off with my first tester marathon workout on Sunday.
