**Chiron Workout Library feature and hilly long run in the SunShine Coast hinterland**

This week, I introduced Chiron’s new Workout Library feature, which allows you to save and schedule your go-to workouts with ease—great for athletes and coaches! I also shared how I use it to schedule my weekly gym sessions.

Training highlights include our track session at Bush Turkey Track Club, a fun but sweaty 30-minute threshold run, and a memorable concert experience with The Amity Affliction. I wrapped up the week with a tough 2.5-hour long run in the Sunshine Coast hinterland, finishing with 113km.
