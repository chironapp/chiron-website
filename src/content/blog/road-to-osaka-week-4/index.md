**Chiron coaching feature and RECC Run the World Relay Gold Coast**

This week, I’m excited to showcase Chiron’s new **Coaching feature**, making it easier for coaches to manage and track their athletes' training!

Training highlights include a fun 5 x 600m track session combined with Bush Turkey Track Club and Moreton Bay Road Runners, and a fantastic win at the **RECC Run the World Relay** where our men’s and women's team took first place!

Finished the week with a 2h 10min long run, wrapping up 89km.
