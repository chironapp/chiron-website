**Chiron Events feature and overtraining injury scare**

Week 6 has been an improvement, and I’m happy to share that I’m back on track with my marathon training. After last week's setbacks, I’m gradually increasing my load and starting to feel more like myself again.

This week, I’m excited to share **Chiron’s training progress tracking features**, which help athletes and caoches stay on top of their training.

As for training, I took Monday off for rest after waiting on MRI results, then resumed training, the week progressed and ended with a fun, muddy 32km adventure long run through Beerburrum East State Forest.

Total mileage for the week: 87km.
