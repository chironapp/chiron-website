Week 7 of my Road to Osaka 2025 series was all about balance—some fun, some solid training, and a little chaos. The highlight? Friday’s Bush Turkey Relay, where my Red Team put in a strong effort to defend our title. It’s always a blast running this event with mates, and congratulations to the White Team for taking the win this year!

On the Chiron front, I showcased the app’s workout merging feature—a game-changer for keeping training logs clean on busy days.

Total mileage for the week: 105km.
