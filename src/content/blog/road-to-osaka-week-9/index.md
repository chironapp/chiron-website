**Chiron bug fixes, marathon workouts, and summer heat**

_Week 9 of my Road to Osaka 2025 series was all about regaining momentum—both in marathon training and app development._

On the Chiron front, I tackled lingering bugs after realizing I’d gone three weeks without committing any code. It’s a small but important step forward, and much like running, it’s about staying consistent.

Training-wise, I focused on staying controlled in the summer heat. The highlight of the week was Sunday’s marathon workout: **4 x 4km at marathon heart rate with 1km float recoveries, totaling 33km.** Huge thanks to Ewan for pacing me on the bike and keeping me hydrated—good company makes all the difference on these long runs.

Total mileage for the week: 105km.
