Yesterday marked a pivotal day in my running journey as I conquered a 10km time trial. It was more than just a race; it was a test of mental strength, something I had been struggling with since the Gold Coast Marathon. My success was not only a testament to the importance of perseverance and continuous learning but also to the enormous potential I have found in Chiron.

The lead up

After the Gold Coast Marathon, I was emotionally drained and filled with self-doubt.

I have now developed Chiron to a point where (the occasional bug aside) it has become my trusted training companion and essential in my journey to breaking 70 minutes at the Melbourne half marathon next month. It helped restore my self-confidence by enabling me to plan my training with precision, track my progress, and set goals, replacing the cumbersome spreadsheets I once relied on.

However, as race day approached, I began to wonder how Chiron could help me and athletes like me strengthen our mental game. Could it be more than just a tool for planning and tracking physical training and goals? Could it provide tools to overcome the inner battles that all athletes face?

Race day and mental strength

As the sun rose on race day, I felt a mix of excitement and nerves. It was a perfect 14°C but much windier than forecast, with a stiff Southerly, which would challenge me for the first 5km. The event was co-hosted by two local running clubs, [Moreton Bay Road Runners](https://www.instagram.com/moretonbayroadrunners/) and [South Pine Striders](https://www.instagram.com/southpinestriders/), 5km out and 5km back along the beautiful Brighton-Sandgate foreshore in Brisbane Australia.

After the race commenced, I took the lead and within the first minute was running solo. I didn't have the usual sideline support from my family, who were out of town for the day, but the encouragement from passing runners as well as team mate Lisa and her kids cheering at multiple checkpoints along the way kept me going. I felt strong at 3km but the temptation to slow down or quit was already nagging at me before the 5km turnaround.

As I pushed through those challenging kilometres, I put into practice some mental tools I had been preparing for the last few weeks:

- I set a mental checkpoint at 7km, telling myself I couldn't slow down or give up until then (Inspired by [Alex Hutchinson's Endure, check it out](/contact)). This inner game kept me focused and determined. By the time I hit 7km, I was too close to the finish to give up.

- Continuous self-talk about keeping my body relaxed and in control helped numb the pain and keep me distracted.

- I relied on two personal mantras I repeated in my head. The first mantra is a reminder that I am strong and capable of achieving my goal. The second is a quote by Carl Jung: a reminder that I made a conscious choice to come here to endure the suffering.

The finish line and Chiron's potential

Crossing the finish line filled me with immense pride. While I was 15s off my time goal, I had achieved a new personal best while running the entire distance solo and conquering the mental hurdles that had plagued me. But it also left me thinking about the untapped potential of Chiron.

Training mental performance with Chiron

I realized Chiron could be more than just a physical training tool. It had the potential to assist users in developing mental strength. I envisioned how Chiron could incorporate personalised mental resilience training plans, or connect users with a community of like-minded athletes who have overcome similar challenges, mindfulness exercises, or guidance in developing personal mantras to overcome mental barriers.

> mental strength is every bit as crucial as physical prowess in endurance sports

Chiron, with its focus on data-driven training, could evolve to a holistic endurance training app, addressing not just physical fitness but mental resilience too. My performance shows that mental strength is every bit as crucial as physical prowess in endurance sports, and Chiron could be the platform to bridge that gap.

Yesterday's success in the 10km time trial was made possible by determination, the support of my local running community, and the assistance of my training companion, Chiron. As I continue my journey, I look forward to seeing how Chiron might evolve to empower athletes not only physically but also mentally.

Let me know if you have any thoughts or ideas on how Chiron might train mental performance.
