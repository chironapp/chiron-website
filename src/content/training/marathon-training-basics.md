# Marathon Training Basics

Running a marathon is an incredible achievement that requires dedication, proper training, and smart preparation. This guide will help you get started on your marathon journey.

## Building Your Base

Before diving into marathon-specific training, it's important to build a solid running base:

1. **Consistent mileage**: Aim for at least 20-25 miles per week for several months
2. **Easy runs**: Most of your runs should be at a conversational pace
3. **Weekly long run**: Gradually build up to running 10-13 miles comfortably

## Key Training Principles

### Progressive Overload

Increase your weekly mileage by no more than 10% per week to avoid injury.

### Recovery

Your body adapts and gets stronger during rest, not during training. Prioritize:
- 7-9 hours of sleep per night
- Rest days or easy cross-training
- Proper nutrition and hydration

### Specificity

Your training should mimic race conditions. Include:
- Tempo runs at marathon pace
- Long runs that build to 20+ miles
- Practice with race-day nutrition

## Sample Week

| Day | Workout |
|-----|---------|
| Monday | Rest or cross-train |
| Tuesday | Easy run (5-6 miles) |
| Wednesday | Tempo run (4 miles + warmup/cooldown) |
| Thursday | Easy run (5-6 miles) |
| Friday | Rest |
| Saturday | Long run (12-20 miles) |
| Sunday | Recovery run (3-4 miles) |

## Final Thoughts

Remember, consistency is key. It's better to run easy and stay healthy than to push too hard and get injured. Listen to your body and enjoy the journey!
